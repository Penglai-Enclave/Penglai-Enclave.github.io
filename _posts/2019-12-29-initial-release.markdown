Hey guys,

It's happy to announce that Penglai Enclave will be open-sourced soon.

Penglai Enclave is a scalable TEE system that can support many secure applications simultaneously.

Please follow our [homepage](penglai-enclave.systems) and our [github](https://github.com/Penglai-Enclave) for the latest information.

Thanks.

Dong and the rest of IPADS@SJTU.
