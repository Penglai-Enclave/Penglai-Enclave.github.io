# Penglai-Enclave Open-Source Plan

Hey guys,

&nbsp; &nbsp; It's happy to announce that Penglai Enclave will be open-sourced soon.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Penglai Enclave is a scalable TEE system that can support many secure applications simultaneously.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Please follow our [homepage](https://penglai-enclave.systems) and our [github](https://github.com/Penglai-Enclave) for the latest information.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks.
