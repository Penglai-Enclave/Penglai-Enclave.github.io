  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>Emerging applications like artificial intelligence and autonomous car require high security-assurance, which stimulates the wide-spread deployment of trusted execution environment (TEE), e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV and ARM TrustZone. 
  However, existing enclave systems are far from the ideal for three reasons.

  <ul class="posts">
      <li>
        <b>Not scalable</b>: they can only support limited security memory (128MB in SGXv1) or limited instances (15 instances in SEV);
      </li>
      <li>
        Can't support <b>high-performance applications</b>, e.g., poor secure communication performance;
      </li>
      <li>
        Still have <b>security limitations</b>, e.g., PT-based side channels in SGX.
      </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
   Penglai-Enclave is proposed to overcome the challenges.
   Penglai is an open-sourced, secure and scalable TEE system for RISC-V.
   Penglai is made powerful through a new hardware-assisted scalable physical memory isolation extension (sPMP) which is introduced to overcome the limited secure regions. 
   Evaluations show that Penglai can achieve more than 100 instances even in a resource-restricted device.
